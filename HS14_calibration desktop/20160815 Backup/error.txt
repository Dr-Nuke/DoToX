Dear all,
since my last Matlab project I encounter some very untypical issues. I have literally no clue about them. apart from that my 
General Situation: I am developing with the Matlab Editor, R2014a and R2014b on 3 different computers and every one of them shows these issues. These issues seem to appear randomly, on average maybe one in 10 times I run a script. They are semi-reproducable. For their strangeness, random appearence and random "workarounds" I consider uploading a screen capure video in case the readers cannot help me here. I appreciate any help, thank you!

I) the last few (typically 4) characters of my current script get "lost", often the end statement of some loop. This of course throws an error. I thought i unintentionally deleted these characters, but ctrl+z wont bring the missing characters back. Up to now I manually rewrite those letters. [code examples yet to be added here]


II) Random not- executing and / or throwing errors. Adding random empty lines and semicolons to the scripts seem so resolve this one.
The following script "colorterst.m" I wrote and the first execution would return the missing END error:

  
  figure()
  hold on
  for i=1:10
      plot([1,2],[3+i/10,4])
      for j=1:5
          disp(j)
      end
  end
  ; 
   
on the second stroke of F5 the script runs as intended. Then, after removing the tailing semicolon and running it

  
  figure()
  hold on
  for i=1:10
      plot([1,2],[3+i/10,4])
      for j=1:5
          disp(j)
      end
  end
  
it would neither execute nor throw an error, but only give me

  >> colorterst
  >> colorterst
  >> colorterst
  >> colorterst
  >> colorterst
  >> colorterst
  >> colorterst

(note: none of the disp(j) is printed!). Adding the semicolon to the disp command lets the script run again.

  figure()
  hold on
  for i=1:10
      plot([1,2],[3+i/10,4])
      for j=1:5
          disp(j);
      end
  end
 
somewhat later, executing

  figure()
  hold on
  a=hsv;
  for i=1:100
      ind_col=ceil(size(a,1)*i/100);
      plot([1,2],[3+i/10,4],'color',a(ind_col,:))
      for j=1:5
         pause(0)
      end
       fprintf('%d ',i)
  end
   
  ;

returns, after changing the two 10's to 100's,

  Error: File: colorterst.m Line: 4 Column: 1
  At least one END is missing: the statement may begin here.

after pasting the code and command line output, i return to the editor and press F5 for the second time and the exact same code properly executes.
